## üßê About <a name = "about">A-Frame</a>

The WebVR and WebGL APIs already enable us to start creating virtual reality (VR) experiences inside web browsers, but the community is still waiting for tools and libraries to appear, to make this easier. Mozilla's A-Frame framework provides a markup language allowing us to build 3D VR landscapes using a system familiar to web developers, which follows game development coding principles; this is useful for quickly and successfully building prototypes and demos, without having to write a lot of JavaScript or GLSL.

The current version of A-Frame is 0.3.2, which means it's highly experimental, but it already works and you can test it right away in the browser. It runs on desktop, mobile (iOS and Android), and Oculus Rift, Gear VR and HTC Vive.

A-Frame is built on top of WebGL, and provides pre built components to use in applications ‚Äî models, video players, skyboxes, geometries, controls, animations, cursors, etc. It is based on the entity component system, which is known in the game development world, but it targets web developers with a familiar markup structure, manipulable with JavaScript. The end result is 3D web experiences, which are VR-enabled by default.
